summary: A first-person VR zombie survival driving game built for the Meta 2 headset. After team members departed, I took sole ownership of the project, implementing vehicle physics, head-aimed turret combat, an interactive cockpit with rear-view camera playback, mini-map system, zombie AI, and a scripted intro cutscene.

## Project Overview

Mister Rogers' Zombiehood is a first-person driving game built in Unity using the Meta 2 AR headset, featuring turret combat, zombie hordes, destructible environments, and full cockpit interactivity. Players navigate a post-apocalyptic suburban nightmare, rescuing survivors and eliminating zombies with their weaponized vehicle.

## Development Experience

What began as a group project quickly transformed into a solo development endeavor when team members departed. Taking complete ownership, I developed all aspects of the game from vehicle physics to zombie AI, overcoming significant technical challenges:

- **No macOS Live Preview Support**: Testing required building iterations to the headset
- **Version Control Issues**: Adapted to broken compatibility after an unexpected Unity version upgrade
- **Complex VR Implementation**: Self-taught VR development principles with limited resources

## Technical Implementation

- **Vehicle Physics & Combat**: Implemented realistic driving mechanics and physics-based zombie collisions
- **Head-Aimed Turret System**: Created a combat system utilizing Meta 2's head tracking for aim control
- **Interactive Cockpit**: Developed a fully functional dashboard including a working rear-view mirror using camera playback technology
- **Mini-Map System**: Implemented an overhead view camera that tracks player movement
- **Zombie AI**: Designed proximity-based detection and chase mechanics for enemy zombies
- **Cutscene System**: Scripted an introductory scene with synchronized events and camera choreography

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases my ability to:
- Take full ownership of complex technical challenges
- Self-learn new technologies with limited documentation
- Implement 3D physics and camera systems
- Design intuitive VR interfaces that minimize motion sickness
- Problem-solve iteratively with limited testing capabilities
- Deliver a completed product despite significant obstacles

## Video Demonstration
