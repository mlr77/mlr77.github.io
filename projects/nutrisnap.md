## Project Overview

NutriSnap is a cross-platform mobile application that promotes mindful eating through AI-driven NOVA food classification, moving beyond traditional calorie counting. As part of a small team (3-5 people), I contributed to building this health-focused app that helps users develop more conscious eating habits.

## Development Contributions

As a core developer on the team, my primary responsibilities included:
- **Frontend UI Development**: Built key interfaces including the camera screen, food journal, dashboard, and user profile using Flutter/Dart
- **AI Model Integration**: Assisted with integrating the Python-based food recognition model with the mobile frontend
- **Firebase Implementation**: Helped design the Firestore database structure and implemented authentication flows
- **Quality Assurance**: Contributed to unit testing and coordinated QA tasks via GitHub Projects
- **User Experience Research**: Participated in usability testing and applied feedback to improve app performance

## Technical Implementation

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Created responsive UI components that functioned consistently across iOS and Android
- **Camera Integration**: Implemented real-time camera functionality for food image capture and analysis
- **State Management**: Used Riverpod/Provider patterns to maintain consistent application state
- **Data Persistence**: Designed and implemented local storage strategies to support offline functionality
- **Cultural Relevance**: Incorporated feedback to improve food recognition across diverse cuisines

## Learning Experience

This project marked my first venture into mobile development, providing valuable experience in:
- Flutter framework and Dart programming
- Firebase ecosystem (Firestore, Authentication)
- Mobile-specific UI/UX considerations
- State management patterns in mobile applications
- Integrating ML models into consumer applications

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases my abilities in:
- Mobile UI development using modern frameworks
- Working with cloud-based backend services
- Collaborating effectively in a small development team
- Incorporating user feedback into technical implementation
- Adapting to new technologies and development paradigms

The final prototype successfully demonstrated the concept of using AI for food classification to promote healthier eating habits, with particular emphasis on a non-judgmental approach to food choices.
