## Project Overview

Kame is a prototype adaptive language learning platform I designed and developed from scratch. The system intelligently adapts to learner performance by analyzing response patterns to identify skill gaps and provide personalized learning paths.

## Solo Development Journey

As the sole developer and architect of this project, I:
- Self-taught PHP/MySQL while simultaneously building the application
- Designed the entire system architecture and database schema
- Implemented all frontend and backend components
- Created a complete working prototype (~113,000 lines of code)
- Developed the project in an era with limited online support resources (pre-Stack Overflow)

## Key Technical Features

- **Multimedia Content Management**: Built a system to ingest and serve text, audio, and visual learning materials
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Developed an engine to create multiple-choice questions with intelligent distractor analysis
- **Skill Gap Identification**: Created algorithms to map incorrect answers to specific language proficiency deficiencies
- **Performance Tracking**: Designed a comprehensive database schema to track learner progress over time
- **Adaptive Logic**: Implemented foundational algorithms to adjust content difficulty based on user performance
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Built a multi-tiered permission system for students, teachers, and administrators

## Technical Challenges Overcome

- **Complex Database Design**: Created relational structures to support adaptive learning without modern ORMs
- **Server-Side Security**: Implemented secure server-side rendering for assessments to prevent answer extraction
- **Self-Learning Ecosystem**: Navigated the complexity of building a production-quality system while learning the technologies

## Future Vision

The platform was designed as a foundation for:
- Automated ILR passage rating
- AI-driven question generation
- Fully personalized learning paths using LLMs

I'm planning a modern rebuild using FastAPI, MongoDB, and React to implement these advanced features with current technologies.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases my abilities in:
- Independent full-stack development
- Complex database design
- Algorithm development for adaptive learning
- System architecture design
- Self-directed learning and problem-solving
- Long-term technical vision and planning
