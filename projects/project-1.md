summary: Our team processed travel information for over 1 billion travelers in 2018 and developed a model to predict probability of delay based on origin, destination, and date/time of travel. The goal was to develop a system for frequent fliers to better manage their travel schedules.

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```python
import numpy as np

predict_delay('01/23/2020 13:40:00', 'ASE', 'IAH')
#sample output (Aspen, CO to Houston, TX, Departure 1:40PM, 87.5% chance of delay.)
```
