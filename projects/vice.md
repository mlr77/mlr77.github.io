## Project Overview

VICE was a large-scale (~300,000 LOC) PHP/MySQL Content Management System supporting over 1,000 users across a multi-facility government training center. The system managed critical workflows including student records, grading, media resources, and logistics.

## Development Contributions

After quickly mastering the existing codebase, I designed and implemented several major new modules:
- **Student Grading System**: Automated assessment tracking, grade calculation, and reporting
- **Media Library Management**: Created a digital checkout system with overdue notices and usage tracking
- **Supply Logistics**: Developed inventory management and request fulfillment workflows
- **User Feedback Module**: Implemented a structured feedback collection and response system
- **Barcode Scanning Integration**: Added hardware integration for physical resource tracking
- **PDF Reporting**: Built customizable report generation for administrative needs

## Critical Incident Response

When the system experienced a major database corruption issue that threatened operations, I:
- Quickly diagnosed the nature and extent of the corruption
- Implemented an emergency data recovery process
- Restored system operations with minimal downtime
- Developed safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future

## Technical Environment

Working within a legacy codebase presented unique challenges:
- Navigating complex interdependencies between system components
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing features
- Implementing modern functionality within legacy architectural constraints
- Ensuring performance at scale with increasing user demands

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases my abilities in:
- Rapidly assimilating large, complex codebases
- Designing and implementing enterprise-scale features
- Critical problem-solving under high-pressure scenarios
- Database troubleshooting and recovery
- Balancing innovation with maintenance in legacy systems

## Impact

The modules I developed significantly enhanced administrative efficiency and data accessibility across the organization, streamlining workflows that previously required substantial manual effort and reducing error rates in critical processes.
