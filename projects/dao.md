## Project Overview

For my Master's thesis, I designed and developed the "Dao" conceptual framework, a significant enhancement to the SAGE3 collaborative environment aimed at supporting hybrid, interdisciplinary data science and AI teams. Dao represents a comprehensive approach to integrating cutting-edge AI capabilities, programmatic control, and spatial organization into a unified collaborative system.

## System Architecture

The Dao framework consists of several integrated components:
- **Seer**: An LLM integration framework using Langchain & BentoML for AI assistance
- **PySAGE3**: A stateful Python API enabling programmatic control of the environment
- **Foresight Engine**: A central coordination system managing interactions between components
