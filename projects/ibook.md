## Project Overview

Co-authored a comprehensive 380-page interactive iBook with a language expert after our school transitioned from PCs to Apple devices (MacBook Pros for teachers, iPads for students). Working intensively for approximately two months (4-6 hours daily), we created a digital curriculum that revolutionized our flipped classroom teaching approach.

## Design Considerations

- **Consistent Layout System**: Leveraged iBooks Author's layout styles to maintain visual consistency while allowing for lesson-specific customization
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Carefully structured table of contents and lesson arrangement for optimal learning flow
- **New Technology Onboarding**: Added icon guides and information pages to help both students and teachers navigate the new interface
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategically reduced media file sizes and used linked vs. embedded content to optimize performance on student devices with limited storage and connectivity

## Technical Implementation

- **Custom Widget Development**: Integrated pre-designed BookWidgets and created custom HTML5 widgets for specialized functionality
- **External Platform Integration**: Built interfaces with Quizlet for vocabulary study and Google Forms for seamless assignment submission
- **Interactive Assessment**: Implemented self-check quizzes and interactive elements to enhance student engagement
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Extensively tested and optimized for consistent performance across Apple devices

## Challenges Overcome

The most significant technical challenge involved navigating font compatibility issues between iBooks Author and iOS devices. Foreign language character display varied dramatically between platforms, forcing layout redesigns and creative workarounds to maintain readability and visual consistency without administrator access to modify individual student devices.

## Impact and Results

The completed iBook modernized our language curriculum, received positive feedback from students, and significantly enhanced the flipped classroom learning experience. This project demonstrated my ability to manage technical projects with strict deadlines, translate curriculum requirements into engaging digital experiences, and solve complex technical problems through creative solutions.
