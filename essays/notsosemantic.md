Often times we use the term "it's just semantics" when arguing a point both parties agree on, but the words used are just not quite the same. In this manner of speaking, I feel the concept of Semantic UI is a little misleading. The idea behind using Semantic UI is that one no longer needs to memorize sometimes arbitrary, almost codeword-like words with heavy syntax to build websites. I somewhat disagree. 

While Semantic UI offers a unique way to build a fairly nice looking website, relatively quickly, with very little css, but there is still plenty of overhead to building a really nice website. In order to better illustrate my frustrations with using Semantic UI, I will highlight a few roadblocks I ran into while cloning websites this week.

## [Roblox](corp.roblox.com)

#### Navigation Bar Formatting

The nav bar is generally very easy to build. Begin by copying the Roblox logo (hotlink to make it easier). Then using Semantic UI, you can just type ""


The class identifiers that are supposed to be simple and easy to remember did not really resonate with me. 


Concise HTML
Semantic UI treats words and classes as exchangeable concepts.

Classes use syntax from natural languages like noun/modifier relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts intuitively.

Get the same benefits as BEM or SMACSS, but without the tedium.
