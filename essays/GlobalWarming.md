Two years ago, I bid farewell to the military after over two decades of service. Fortunately, the decision to retire came easy since there was not much left to do and the prospect of getting promoted further was non-existent. After first joining, I progressed quickly through the ranks but after about 10 years, I went from technical expert to well, technical expert. I even spent almost my entire career at one location, and did not deploy once. Don't get me wrong, my job was both exciting and rewarding the reality check for me came as it became time to transition into "senior leadership" positions. I took the required classes, and mingled with the appropriate people but I did not want to end up spending my last ten years playing volleyball and pretending to work. No offense to those of you who excel at this sort of thing but transitioning into management can be like getting stuck in a for-loop. You might have gotten there by accident and there might not be a way back out. 

Instead, I decided to try something new. Shortly after departing the military I received a random job offer to work as a liaison officer with the Pentagon. In my interview I explained that I did not have even the most basic requirements for the job but somehow the employer and goverment were both convinced I would be a perfect fit. I acccepted the challenge and found myself at a new phase in my life, no longer lamenting about giving up my technical job and instead I actually enjoyed working with all the "senior leaders." I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest military and civilian minds. 

........not finished......
