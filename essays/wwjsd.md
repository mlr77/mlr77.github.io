# What Would Jon Skeet Do?

What exactly is a good question on Stackoverflow? The answer is literally posted in broad daylight at  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). This page covers almost everything. Right at the top, you will find a large “Search” hyperlink. While it may seem obvious, the number of questions asked time and time again are insane. Do not frantically post questions without first doing some proper research. Next up, the help page covers how to formulate a well constructed, professional question, beginning with the title, structure, grammar, the to-dos and not-to-dos, and includes a reminder to proof-read before posting. They even have sub-sections to discuss things like, “How do I ask and answer homework questions?” So why are there still so many bad questions? That is a silly question. 

Although my guess is that most people do not take the time to read the help section, perhaps some people just do not even have the time to think about it. They need answers and they need them now. I know when I am stuck on a problem or have a tight deadline it would be nice to have an answer immediately. Searching takes up too much time, and the time it takes to craft the perfect question might be better spent solving the problem independently. Google is for curiosity while StackOverflow is for expert help, quickly. This could be the reason, or it could be that many people do not even care.

I do not want to jump to conclusions so I decided to heed the advice of the help section and first search for a clue. My search quickly brought me to another awesome resource, StackExchange. [StackExchange](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/). This is where we begin the journey for the truth. 

<h2>Follow the Bread Crumbs</h2>

StackExchange allows users to run database queries on all sorts of fun and useful information. Most importantly, many users have already written amazing queries and all we have to do is use them to piece together what may be happening. Ideally, I would love to take the results and run some Machine Learning models to explore the data further, but in the interest of time, I will focus on a few discoveries. If not, I could (and would gladly) spend months sifting through all this data. In fact, if I found this site a few months ago I would have definitely used it for my Probability and Statistics class. 

I first looked for some interesting sounding query titles. Here are some examples that I found: 

- Good Questions vs. Bad Questions Ratio
- Time to Answer
- Posts containing a very short title
- Most Down-Voted Questions
- Users by Popular Question ratio
- Find the top 200 questions with most views
- Fastest Guns in the West
- High Standards - Top 100 Users that rarely upvote
- Find interesting unanswered questions
- Jon Skeet comparison
