## What type of procrastinator are you? 

On day one of Software Engineering class, our professor warned the class about procrastination, describing it as a type of fear. The dictionary offers a less abstract notion, defining it as the act of delaying or postponing something, and a quick Google search shows "people also ask" the following common questions: 

* Is procrastination a mental illness?
* What are the 4 types of procrastinators?
* What is the root cause of procrastination?
* Is procrastination a form of control? 

Whether you feel procrastination is a phycological disorder or a critical skill in life, I would bet each of us has experienced it in some form and many of us are routinely afflicted by it. More importantly, if not managed properly, procrastination will almost certainly negatively impact our performance when it comes to software engineering. 

I may or may not be the best person to write about this topic as I, myself, am a recovering procrastinator. The struggle of finding something to write about is real. The deadline for our website and first writing assignment is upon us. 

## What to do?

Start writing. Sure, why not? Although, I did not complete every topic in this week's module, at least I can explain why I have yet to finish and perhaps by the time I finish walking you all through my thought process, together we can figure out the root cause. The key is to move forward. 

When I realized Module 3 contains assignments due several days before Module 2 is finished, this was my process: 

### Step 1. Take a look at the module and check out the readings. 

I love to read, and also the estimated "read time" is listed which makes it easy to manage my time. One of my favorite apps to read from, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, also has this great feature. A quick scan indicated the reading should only take about 30 minutes. Great. Unfortunately, all but one of the readings turned out to be videos. The actual reading material was a link to an e-book on Github. No, thank you. In all fairness, there were little tags describing each reading as either a screencast or reference manual. I did watch each of the videos and scanned the reference document just to get an idea if it will be useful in the future.

### Step 2. Get distracted.

This is, in fact, a step in my process, as avoiding distractions is nearly impossible. Another piece of advice offered in class was to put our cell phones and other social media devices away, so we are not distracted by them. Done. However, I still have about 20 web pages open, including LinkedIn, Techhui, YouTube, JSFiddle, etc., and of course my Slack app continues to notify me of any new messages. I am glad to discover the source of that clicking noise finally.

As a master procrastinator, (yes, it almost rhymes), I chose to get distracted for a few minutes and then press on. My "few minutes" turned out to be spent on wondering whether or not I should close all my web browser windows and shut down Slack. I decided against it because I may forget which sites were open and it will take more time to load them again.

### Step 3. Take a break. 

Of course! I just spent over 10 minutes getting distracted so it must be time for a break. When I come back, I am sure that I will be refreshed and ready to continue. But, before I go, I want to take a look at the Module again to see how much is left to finish. It looks like Workout of the Day (WOD) practice algorithms will not take very long... but wait. What's this? I see another section tucked in the lower-left hand corner. It seems I will need to sign up for another course which should only take a maximum of 10 hours. Whoa. My procrastination Spidey sense is tingling. Ugh, and now I have delayed my break.

### Step 4. Where was I? 

Oh, I never really took a break yet. I got distracted and began fixing a few grammar errors. 

Let's face it. There was no process to begin with. The true first step is to admit we have a problem. As software engineers, we need to first identify the problem, and then come up with solutions to solve the problem. I admit I am a procrastinator. I did, however, find a useful tool along the way. After watching the first practice WOD screencast, I downloaded the recommended an app for tracking time, aptly called, "Thyme." I see what you did there. I enjoy how simple it is and plan to use it to tackle the Intro to JavaScript course, extended version. With any luck it will not take long to finish.

### Two Days Later

Okay, the time has come to wrap up this essay about JavaScript. I actually feel JavaScript is quite amazing. I have written a few small programs that all functioned properly and only needed a few samples to get started. As a beginner, the following three things are key: 

1. Use let instead of var (although JavaScript does not get jealous if you call out the wrong name)
2. To print, use the console.log() function
3. There are style preferences, but syntax mistakes are easily forgiven

JavaScript is pretty much synonymous with the internet, where almost anything is possible. And while it seems this essay is a little all over the place, I think it is in line with JavaScript. The most important takeaway is that we should strive for greatness, but when you cannot be great, at least get something done and take a moment to appreciate the small victories. 

Thyme and JSFiddle for the win!
