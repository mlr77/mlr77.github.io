Several years ago my wife and I set out to renovate our home. Neither of us had any experience, but we had a vision. Little did we know that we would wind up in a real life rendition of the Tom Hanks movie, The Money Pit. As with any project, there are several ways to get started, and really only one of two possible outcomes, success, or failure. There are decisions to be made during each step in the journey, and often times it is difficult if not impossible to know how everything will turn out in advance.

The renovation project began with acquiring permits, interviewing various contractors, working with a drafter to help pen the blueprints for our dream home. Ironically enough, our drafter's name was Penn. We spent a few months planning, or at least thinking we were planning, but we were really still just dreaming about what will happen at that point. Meanwhile, the drafter finished the blueprints and secured the permits to start working. A local bank set us up with a construction loan, and we were in business. The only thing left to do was choose a contractor to do the work. To backtrack a bit, the reason for the renovation was not entirely by design. In fact, I thought I could do it myself and ended up demolishing our bathroom and kitchen. Standing in the rubble, I quickly realized there was no way I can put it back together again. Rule number one, know your limits.

In October of that year, we finally settled on a small contracting business who agreed to do everything we wanted in just 80 days. There were of course many choices, but budget and reputation factored into our decision. The bank we worked with hinted they would be a good choice, and the price/timeline seemed ideal...not the best, but reasonable. I actually can probably write an entire book on the what happened next, and someday I would like to, but for now, I just want to point out a few of the things that went wrong.

In progres...
