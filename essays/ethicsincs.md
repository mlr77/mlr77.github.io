Ethics in technology is a grey world. This is not necessarily a correct point of view, but it is the viewpoint of many people actively engaging in unethical behavior across all spectrums of society. For each rule, whether written or unspoken, there is always another side to the story or some argument to be made that allows for loopholes. Unfortunately, this is also the case when it comes to technology. There are times when a software engineer’s intent is undermined by evildoers, and other times a program built for nefarious reasons finds its use turns out to be value. Technology is used for just about everything nowadays so when we talk about ethics in technology, or ethics applied to software engineering, we are really sometimes just talking about ethics, period. For example, an app designed to bring people together to talk about religion might be used to start a cult. Social media and dating apps are often used for human trafficking.*1 Zoom*2, now used by millions as we are forced to work online, is very likely being used to actively engage in corporate espionage. 

The article, The code I’m still ashamed of, (Sourour, 2016), the author talks about being recruited to build a survey site for patient’s health concerns. Initially, the build requirements seemed reasonable due to his employer’s qualifications, but after building the site and realizing it was used to steer patients toward a particular drug manufactured by the same company, he quickly felt ashamed as it was clearly unethical. The article resonated with me because my son is working in a similar situation for a multimillion-dollar company in Japan, with free room and board but with a low salary. This type of situation sadly quite common. Companies often seek out young, enthusiastic software engineers, targeting those with without college degrees, to build illegal software or websites. The recruits see it as an opportunity to hone their skills and build up their resume, while the employers take advantage by having the employee work on small sections of code that senior software engineers do not want to be associated with. Unfortunately, unlike Bill’s moment of clarity, many people turn a blind eye to what is happening and deflect by telling themselves it is the company that is unethical, and they are simply providing a skillset. It is true to some extent, if they leave, someone else will quickly and willingly fill the void. But that does not necessarily make it right. 

Complacent vs. complaisant
