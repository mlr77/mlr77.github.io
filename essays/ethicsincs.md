Draft 1.
Ethics may seem black and white to some, but for most it lives in a shady, grey world. This is not necessarily my point of view, it just is. At this moment, people are actively engaging in unethical behavior across all spectrums of society. The expression "moral compass" is often used to define one's ethical behavior, but unlike a compass that always points due North, morals vary from region to region, culture to culture, person to person. For each rule, whether written or unspoken, there is always another side to the story or some argument to be made that allows for loopholes. Unfortunately, this is also the case when it comes to technology. 

There are times when a software engineer’s intent is undermined by evildoers, and other times a program designed for nefarious reasons is ultimately used for good. Technology is used for just about everything nowadays so when we talk about ethics in technology, or ethics as it applies to software engineering, we are really just talking about ethics, period. For example, an app designed to bring people together to talk about religion might be used to start a cult. Social media and dating apps are often used for human trafficking.*1 Zoom*2, now used by millions as we are forced to work online, is very likely being used to actively engage in corporate espionage. 

In the article <span style="text-decoration:underline">The code I’m still ashamed of</span> (Sourour, 2016), Bill Sourour talks about being recruited to build a survey site for a marketing firm sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Initially, Bill trusted everything was on the up and up considering reputation of the clients, but after building the site and realizing he played a part in a scheme to hook teenage girls on certain drugs (that ultimately led to many suicides), he quit the job and expressed remorse. 

The article resonated with me because my son is now working in an unremunerative software engineering job (which is kind of an oxymoron) for a multimillion-dollar company in Japan. Similar to what Bill described, he receives free room and board, and gets the opportunity to work on high level projects without the same burdens levied on senior engineers. Occasionally, he is asked to work on projects that are questionable at best. Nothing in life is free. I believe companies often seek out enthusiastic, yet inexperienced software engineers because it can be a bit of a safety net. A conditional ternary for this situation might look something like this:

```javascript
ifCaught ? blame on scapegoat : make money
```

What could go wrong, right? The recruits see it as an opportunity to hone their skills and build up their resume, while  employers take advantage by having the employee work on small sections of code that senior software engineers do not want to be associated with. Unfortunately, unlike Bill’s moment of clarity, many people turn a blind eye to what is happening and deflect by telling themselves it is the company that is unethical, and they are simply providing a skill set. It is true to some extent, if they leave, someone else will quickly and willingly fill the void. But, does that make it right? 

### Complacent and Complaisant

In Bill's story, he claims he did not know what was happening until it was too late. In my previous line of work, we were notorious for stove piping. Access to information was always on a “need-to-know” basis. One could argue this is important to keep secrets safe, but in reality this practice carries the inherent risk of people engaging in "you-don't-want-to-know" types of things. In the article, Bill discovered his website indirectly led to a string of teenage suicides, but at what point did he realize something was amiss? Problem solving is the very essence of programming. I reckon he must have known something was up early on but did not want to take full responsibility for his actions. That is the problem. Many people will question, but not many people will take a stance. In order to meet ...getting there...
