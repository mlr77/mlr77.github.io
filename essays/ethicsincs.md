## The Wonder Years 

Now review through the Case Studies (Haraassment, Privacy, Autonomous Cars, Facebook, etc), and pick one of these studies to focus on for your technical essay.

Write an interesting, informative technical essay about ethics in software engineering. You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering. Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?
