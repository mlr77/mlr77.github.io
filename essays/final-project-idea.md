# Project PAT

_Problem_: Coronavirus (COVID-19) is wreaking havoc across the world and in an effort to mitigate the spread of this deadly virus, Gov. David Ige recently announced statewide restrictions affecting social activities throughout Hawaii. Moreover, following Spring Break 2020, UH Manoa transitioned to online classes __only__, which we today learned will continue for the foreseeable future across all 10 campuses. These changes are likely to cause increased anxiety over concerns for loved ones. Students' may gain weight due to lack of outdoor activities (parks and beaches shut down), or they may feel agitated and become reckless due to lack of in-person social interaction. Others may become depressed from pure boredom or the inability to grasp complex subjects on their own. All of stress added to the already overwhelming responsibility to manage life and grades could compromise our immune systems lead to even more problems.  

_Solution_: The PAT application will provide an outlet to help students reduce some of this heavy burden. Just days ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the #PlayApartTogether campaign, which encourages in-home, social game play and game creation as a safe alternative to going out. Who know's how long this will last? WHO does not. UH game developers and gamers alike can now have a venue to meet up based on common interests, share ideas to develop new games or schedule times for online gaming. It's called PAT, and it's not just for ICS students in the ACM discord chat, it's for all students.

## Overview

UH students and designated faculty can create an account using UH e-mail addresses. Most user roles are self designated (except site admin). They are noob, aficionado, passerbyer, or something to that effect. Admins can monitor community pages and remove garbage posts. Really this is just a space to spend some quality alone time, together with other hommies, keeping safe, maintaining social distance. Students can talk about games, new tools to create games, setup times to meet up online and collaborate on projects or just play games together (Twister not allowed at this time). However, if you want to build a VR Twister using webcams or something like Kinect, this would be the place to post an idea, meet some new virtual friends and make it happen. If you succeed, share about what went right, wrong, or sell your new idea to an investor and retire, if that's what floats your boat. 

## Mockup page ideas
<ul>
  <li>Landing page</li>
  <li>Create/Manage profile page</li>
  <li>Admin page</li>
  <li>Student (logged in) page</li>
  <li>Student Cards (based on interests, search, or some type of auto filter)</li>
  <li>Gamers Forum</li>
  <li>GameDev Forum</li>
  <li>Random Ideas Page</li>
  <li>FAQ Page</li>
</ul>

## Use case ideas

<ul>
  <li>Reach the landing page where some recent activity is shared, maybe some recent news/events, game reviews from UH students, nice pictures, and a nav bar near the top to sign-in, etc. Browse, leave, create account, or sign-in</li>
  <li>Once signed in, users will have access to other student profile cards, and they can choose to be part of any forum, or maybe choose types of things show up on their personalized student page</li>
  <li>Gamers forum can be used for more experienced gamers to share gaming tips, possibly a calendar to setup #PlayApartTogether group gaming times</li>
  <li>GameDev Forum can be used to link to gamedev basics tutorials, answer questions for anyone interested in getting started, share ideas and create teams to build games, or any apps really. If logged in, you can post something, comment/reply, etc.</li>
  <li>At least part of the page should be completely random...filling up with things that might pique one's curiosity. Each time the user visits the page, content may be different</li>
</ul>

##Beyond the basics
<ul>
<li>Ideally, there will be an actual app that can be downloaded, but I'm not sure how it would be distributed if it can be done. Maybe just set it as a free download in the app store and only let UH users access it. It think this is possible.</li>
<li>It would be great to setup statistics tracking. We could possibly add a favorites option or thumbs up option to posts to track trending data on games or even use the data to automatically trigger new ideas/people networks. For example, if two people do not know each other but they seem to be talking a lot about the same things, maybe the site can "introduce" them to each other through some type of notification system.</li>
</ul>
