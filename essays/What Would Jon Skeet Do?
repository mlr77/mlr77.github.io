## What Would Jon Skeet Do?

What exactly is a good question on Stackoverflow? The answer is literally posted in broad daylight at https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask. This page covers almost everything. Right at the top, you will find a large “Search” hyperlink. While it may seem obvious, the number of questions asked time and time again are insane. Do not frantically post questions without first doing some proper research. Next up, the help page covers how to formulate a well constructed, professional question, beginning with the title, structure, grammar, the to-dos and not-to-dos, and includes a reminder to proof-read before posting. They even have sub-sections to discuss things like, “How do I ask and answer homework questions?” So why are there still so many bad questions? That is a silly question. 

Although my guess is that most people do not take the time to read the help section, perhaps some people just do not even have the time to think about it. They need answers and they need them now. I know when I am stuck on a problem or have a tight deadline it would be nice to have an answer immediately. Searching takes up too much time, and the time it takes to craft the perfect question might be better spent solving the problem independently. Google is for curiosity while StackOverflow is for expert help, quickly. This could be the reason, or it could be that many people do not even care.
